# Application Re-platforming Demo: VM to Container with Google Cloud

## üöÄ Modernize Your Applications with Migrate to Containers

Welcome to the automated demo script showcasing the power of Google Cloud's Migrate to Containers service. This demo walks you through the process of transforming a traditional virtual machine-based application into a containerized solution ready for deployment on Cloud Run or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

### üåü What This Demo Offers

- **Automated Migration**: Experience the seamless transition from VM to container with minimal manual intervention.
- **Real-world Scenario**: Follow a practical example of modernizing a legacy application.
- **Cloud-Native Readiness**: Prepare your application for deployment on modern, scalable platforms like Cloud Run and GKE.
- **Best Practices**: Learn Google Cloud's recommended approaches for application modernization.

### üîç Key Features Explored

1. **Application Assessment**: Analyze the existing VM-based application for containerization suitability.
2. **Automated Containerization**: Convert the application to a container format without extensive code changes.
3. **Dependency Management**: Identify and manage application dependencies during the migration process.
4. **Configuration Adaptation**: Adjust application configurations for container-based environments.
5. **Integration with Cloud Run/GKE**: Prepare the containerized application for deployment on Google Cloud platforms.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Verify the functionality and performance of the migrated application.
